# KutzNN Dataset

Data/ContestData.mat contains two input and output 150000 x 3 arrays. The input array holds 150000 points in time
sampled from a particle moving on the Lorentz attractor. The output array holds all the points in the input array
shifted one step ahead in time.

Data/ContestData2.mat contains two input and output 150000 x 3 arrays. These two arrays are the input
and output arrays of Data/ContestData.mat with noise added on top.
